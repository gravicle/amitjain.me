## Me

I am an iOS engineer with a passion for UX. I mostly write about iOS, Swift, and reducing complexity in software.

## This blog

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) blog, hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com). All the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gravicle/amitjain.me). The theme is a modified version of [Masha Safina](http://masha.space/)'s [Captain's Log](https://github.com/mashlo/captains-log).
